# Hangman Game - CodeAlpha Task 1

This is my submission for Task 1 of the CodeAlpha Internship. I have created a simple Hangman game using Python. In this game, the user has to guess a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. The player has limited chances to guess the word correctly.

## How to run the game

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open the terminal or command prompt in the folder where the file is saved.
4. Run this command:


Example Gameplay :-
~~~
🎮 Welcome to Hangman!
Guess the word one letter at a time.
You have 6 incorrect guesses allowed.

Word:  _ _ _ _ _
Enter a letter: a
✅ Good guess!

Word:  a _ _ _ _
Enter a letter: b
❌ Wrong guess! Attempts left: 5

...
✅ Congratulations! You guessed the word: apple
